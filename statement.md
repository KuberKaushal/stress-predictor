# Project Statement  
## Stress Level Prediction System

### Objective  
To design and implement a simple, interpretable system that predicts a person's stress level based on measurable lifestyle features. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts, data abstraction, linear models, and user-friendly output formatting.

### Problem Description  
Stress is influenced by multiple behavioral and physiological factors. This project models stress as a score between 0 and 100 using three features:
- Average heart rate (BPM)  
- Daily sleep duration (hours)  
- Weekly work duration (hours)

The system uses a lightweight linear prediction formula to estimate the stress score and classify it into Low, Moderate, or High risk categories.

### Scope  
The project includes:
- Structured data representation using classes  
- A linear stress prediction model  
- Input options (sample dataset, manual entry, CSV import)  
- Clean tabular output  
- Optional CSV export of results  
- Readable and maintainable Python implementation  

### Deliverables  
- Python program implementing prediction logic  
- README documentation  
- Detailed project report  
- Optional CSV dataset
